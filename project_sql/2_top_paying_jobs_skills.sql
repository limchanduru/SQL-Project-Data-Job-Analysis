/*
SQL dominates â†’ It remains the foundation of data analyst roles.

Python is strong â†’ Its presence shows demand for scripting, automation, and advanced analytics.

Visualization & BI tools vary â†’ Employers list different tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI) rather than one standard, suggesting flexibility is valued.

Cloud data warehousing is relevant â†’ Mentions of Snowflake and BigQuery show that modern data analysts often work with cloud ecosystems.

Statistical & version control skills appear â†’ R (for stats) and GitHub (for collaboration/version control) are less common but noteworthy.

ðŸ‘‰ Overall, a strong candidate would prioritize SQL + Python, and add one or two BI/cloud tools depending on the industry.
